# Create a Go module

Source: [Tutorial: Create a Go module](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module)

## About

This tutorial's sequence includes seven brief topics that each illustrate a different part of the Go language.

1. [x] Create a module -- Write a small module with functions you can call from another module.
2. [x] Call your code from another module -- Import and use your new module.
3. [ ] Return and handle an error -- Add simple error handling.
4. [ ] Return a random greeting -- Handle data in slices (Go's dynamically-sized arrays).
5. [ ] Return greetings for multiple people -- Store key/value pairs in a map.
6. [ ] Add a test -- Use Go's built-in unit testing features to test your code.
7. [ ] Compile and install the application -- Compile and install your code locally.
